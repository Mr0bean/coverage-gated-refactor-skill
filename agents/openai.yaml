  default_prompt: "Capture user refactor goal and scope first, step-load matching reference files from reference/ using 场景_语言_架构 naming, prioritize oversized file decomposition, enforce 90 percent module coverage with runnable tests before each refactor, execute autonomously end-to-end when requested, update related documentation, and finish only when all selected modules plus historical tests pass."
