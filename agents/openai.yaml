  default_prompt: "Detect frontend/backend/language/architecture partitions first, load only relevant reference packs, research official best practices for each partition, prioritize oversized file decomposition, enforce 90 percent module coverage with runnable tests before each refactor, execute autonomously end-to-end when requested, update related documentation, and finish only when all selected modules plus historical tests pass."
