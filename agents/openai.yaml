  default_prompt: "Detect project partitions first, then step-load only matching packs from ./fornt ./backend ./python ./typescript ./nextjs, use local source snapshots in sources/*.md to derive best practices, prioritize oversized file decomposition, enforce 90 percent module coverage with runnable tests before each refactor, execute autonomously end-to-end when requested, and finish only when all selected modules plus historical tests pass."
