# fornt Distilled Best Practices

## Key Decisions

- Prioritize component purity and predictable state ownership before decomposition.
- Organize UI code by feature/domain boundaries to avoid cross-component coupling.
- Keep style-guide conformance as a non-functional gate during refactor.

## Usage

- Use these distilled points as refactor constraints before touching code.
- Validate each adopted point with tests and regression gates.
