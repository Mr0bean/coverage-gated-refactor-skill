# typescript Distilled Best Practices

## Key Decisions

- Enable strict type checks and treat type errors as blockers before refactor.
- Use explicit domain types instead of broad structural types.
- Keep API contracts and internal models separated for safer incremental decomposition.

## Usage

- Use these distilled points as refactor constraints before touching code.
- Validate each adopted point with tests and regression gates.
