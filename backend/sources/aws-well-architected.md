Introduction

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions
you make while building systems on AWS. Using the Framework helps you learn architectural
best practices for designing and operating secure, reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and
sustainable workloads in the AWS Cloud.  It provides a way for you to consistently measure
your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement. The process for
reviewing an architecture is a constructive conversation about architectural decisions, and is
not an audit mechanism. We believe that having well-architected systems greatly increases the
likelihood of business success.

AWS Solutions Architects have years of experience architecting solutions across a wide
variety of business verticals and use cases. We have helped design and review thousands of
customers’ architectures on AWS. From this experience, we have identified best practices and
core strategies for architecting systems in the cloud.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework documents a set of foundational questions that help
you to understand if a specific architecture aligns well with cloud best practices. The
framework provides a consistent approach to evaluating systems against the qualities you expect
from modern cloud-based systems, and the remediation that would be required to achieve those
qualities. As AWS continues to evolve, and we continue to learn more from working with our
customers, we will continue to refine the definition of well-architected.

This framework is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology
officers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members. It describes AWS best
practices and strategies to use when designing and operating a cloud workload, and provides
links to further implementation details and architectural patterns. For more information, see
the   AWS
Well-Architected homepage    .

AWS also provides a service for reviewing your workloads at no charge. The    AWS Well-Architected
Tool     (AWS WA Tool) is a service in the cloud that provides a consistent process for
you to review and measure your architecture using the AWS Well-Architected Framework. The AWS WA
Tool provides recommendations for making your workloads more reliable, secure, efficient, and
cost-effective.

To help you apply best practices, we have created   AWS Well-Architected
Labs    , which provides you with a repository of code and documentation to give you
hands-on experience implementing best practices. We also have teamed up with select AWS Partner
Network (APN) Partners, who are members of the   AWS Well-Architected
Partner program    . These AWS Partners have deep AWS knowledge, and can help you review
and improve your workloads.
