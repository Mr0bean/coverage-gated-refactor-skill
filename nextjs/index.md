# nextjs Partition Pack

## Load Rule

- Load this pack only when `nextjs` partition is detected.
- Read `summary.md` first, then load specific source files as needed.

## Available Source Files

- `sources/nextjs-data-fetching.md`
- `sources/nextjs-project-structure.md`
- `sources/nextjs-route-handlers.md`

## Step Loading

1. Read `summary.md` for distilled decisions.
2. Open only the source files needed by the current module.
3. Map adopted practices to concrete code/test/doc actions.
